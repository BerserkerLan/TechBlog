This is quite painful when you have multiple localhost sessions and have no idea which one looks like what. Windows and Linux, you can just hover and it shows visually how the window actually LOOKS, so you can easily know which application window it was and open it. This is such a wierd thing for Macs to not have, it feels like I’m using very old software in some outdated time that cannot display the application visually while hovering. This is utterly dissapointing from a company that claims to have premium software, often asking for the premium price for this.

However, still it is a positive for MacOS. Rather, this particular point wasn’t a big issue in older Macbooks, it is an issue that came about from Apple’s ‘new’ ProMotion Display (fancy name for just a 120Hz display, typical Apple to be fair). How is this a negative then? I just stated two positives! Somehow, two positives make a negative when it comes to Apple, as on ProMotion displays, I observed that there is a bigger delay when workspace switching, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/rfmg4e/workspace_switching_takes_almost_twice_as_long/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" target="_blank">I’m not the only one</a>.',Fe,ue,At="The reddit post explains it with a video, but somehow due to Apple’s implementation, it takes TWICE the amount of time to switch a workspace with a ProMotion display than a normal 60Hz one.

I cannot fathom how they made something that was actually quite fun to do terrible and annoying on the new models, to the point that I have to change my workflow to using one workspace. I used to get around the pain point of multiple windows not showing in the dock on point 7, by having that window open in another workspace and simply swiping to it on the mousepad, however now with the delay become ever so frustrating, I have to force myself to go the round about way of right clicking the icon and switching to the other window.

But aha, this is Apple we’re talking about, there is yet one more fee I haven’t gone over, the annual $99 fee for any app on the app store, any developer account. It depends on the reader if this amount seems high or low, but alas you must be confident your app can earn atleast this much annually, otherwise you’re just losing money. Sure, earning money isn’t everything for every developer, they’d happily put their app up if this $99 annual fee seems less to them to make it easier for their users to install, however one can just not put it on the app store and allow the user to download from their website instead, further making me confused what the app store provides.',Ze,ce,Wt='But hey, you’re purchasing an application from the store, surely they are bound to Apple policies which totally allow refunds or trials versions before you commit?

You’ll have to scout for reviews and videos of the application to check if it suits your purpose, when you could just directly download the application from some website, and try it out, which leaves the option of having a free trial completely up to the developer instead of some third party app store.',$e,$,Et='<a href="#4-what-is-gaming">4.
